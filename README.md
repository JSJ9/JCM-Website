# JCM-Website
A website I made for a Home Remodeling company.

APRIL 2021 - MAY 2021

I made a website for the company JCM Construction and Design. This is still a work in progress as there are some issues with the website regarding spacing.
Because this is currently a work in progress, the verion you see may not be the updated version. Some images are there are as placeholders and some details may be off.

This was a really fun project as I have never gotten my hands on HTML or CSS or any source code editor. It was an interesting experience as I learned 
so much about JS, PHP, HTML, and CSS. As my first website to ever build and host, I feel like this is a solid job. 

Having experience in the graphic design and art field helped me incredibly with coming up with the company's logo, color palette, and helped me in implementing principles of 
design.
